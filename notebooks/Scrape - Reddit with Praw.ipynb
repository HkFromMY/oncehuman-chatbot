But in order to keep playing the game which I do want to, I have to make new characters otherwise I won't have anything to do in the game due to how small I see the game as. As for seasons, I believe transferring your character only applies if you're going to a normal or hard server which I have no interest in, I don't think you can transfer your character to another novice server so a 3 star last valor is pretty much as good as you can get.--------------------------------------------------------\n",
