      "I raised this issue before the release of this scenario. Who gets to keep these rare deviations if it's a whole hive/faction helping to cap and secure it? Unless one person did the entire cap/securing by themselves, the other players will feel a bit ripped off helping one person get the rarest deviation and spending 2+ hours doing it. Yes, there's faction points but that's not enough.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fact that people helping get nothing - while the popularity contest leaderboard toppers get literal thousands of starchrom - is just insult on top of the broken legs and stomped balls that is this scenario.\n",

      "\n",
      "I can agree from a \"I caught every shiny not carrying about level\" because I'm a Pokemon fan and want one of each. From a gameplay stance, the likelihood of one of those dropping at lvl 5 is probably really damn rare overall. I'm not on that phase yet so feel free to tell me this part is wrong if so. But the idea is that you are trying to beat the other faction. I think we should get the variant option somehow, even if it's not prism though so people who like to collect can have one as well.\n",
      "Also agree with the other comment that the rewards being tied to a player are a trash system. This I believe more than the variant are causing fights, grieving and a loss of points for some factions because people want to rank.\n",
      "Here's hoping they do at least a few tweaks to the system.\n",
      "Side thought, the variant being rare could be used to keep people playing the scenario.\n",

      "\n",
      "I really don't understand why people which are helping with purification get nothing. I don't think that points for faction are enough when only one lucky player gets points for ranking and deviation as well. Like am I sitting there for hours just to get 3 more gamba crates at the end?\n",
      "\n",
      "That is definitely a major downside . I'm not incentivized to help anyone capture , especially when it's gonna reach 2 hours ,capture time , at all . I'm mostly just chilling on prismverse for extra rewards but not much else .\n",

      "The top 10 actually only gets 1000 extra starchrom if the chest is claimed by more than 20 people.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yeah. It would be cool if everyone who was guarding or helping to defend the territory to get maybe 1 point? Since purifying the deviant nets u 10. Then everyone who helped defend also get something out of it\n",
      "\n",
      "def agree, that whole guarding sthick is so stupid. its already bad enough we have to drive over to these purification zones but there's no visible timer no rewards no nothing for helping defend the purification. at least make it trigger a zone so that we get points we can spend on deviants or a bit of starchrome for participating in the pvp event the whole scenario is suppose to be based around.\n"
