With a rapid shot calibration and lone wolf armor it's relatively easy to get the missing ~16% (I think, need to check for actual numbers) magazine capacity from mods to get 20 shots, which means the souvenir will grant 2 shots, so you'll effectively never have to reload.\\n\\nI can see that as a highly optimized build that some people could have, I can add a clause that it will require quite high Crit Rate since when starting out the build you would neuter yourself sticking with RB until you have those thresholds.\\n\\nDo you know the ratio of Crit Rate Needed/Damage when needing to use that?  \\nAt what Crit Rate do you need to hit before RB starts being better them Bombardier?\\n\\nI have gotten up to about \\\\~30% Crit Rate (Base before adding in all the buffs) and got pretty close for RB vs Bombardier.\\n\\nGlad to see this helping out, I can definitly get a infographic going for the armor pieces.\\n\\nWhich one lol\\n\\nPlay how you want but it’s a big dps loss.\\n\\nYa the never reload is really nice, I agree.
