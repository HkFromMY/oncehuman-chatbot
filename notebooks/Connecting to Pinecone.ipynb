I hope its better for you than me in this game currently. You may have seen a few posts from folks on NA P\\\\_Clash-X0004 who\\'s friends got permabanned for unknown reasons while driving around. Welp, I\\'m one of those friends. My in-game name was Huenheim, and my ID is 150278471. \\n\\nI\\'m mostly making this post so its clear and from one of the people it directly happened to. I want to assure you that I am NOT a cheater. I get that every cheater says that, and I have zero ways to \"prove it\", but its 100% the truth. I\\'m an old Destiny 2 head, and trust me when I say you build up a pretty healthy intolerance for cheating after going through the hell of cheaters in PVP in that game. Honestly, I\\'m not sure me or any my crew will ever return to this game, which is a real shame because we really were loving it, but this Sword of Damocles that\\'s hanging over all our heads about these bans is really putting all of us off.\\n\\nHere is the sequence of events from my perspective:\\n\\n-I have been in the process of moving to a new house recently, and thus was unable to play with any real regularity for the week preceding the day I got banned. I played a small amount later in the evenings on a day or two (mostly to make the kind of drone I spec\\'d into for some Hive-mates and tend my farm), but otherwise, I think I maybe went exploring once.\\n\\n-The day we got banned, one of my Hive-mates made a wild truck we all called \"The Killdozer\". It was basically a giant rectangle made out of window walls that we could shoot missile launches out from. It was janky, moved slow as hell, and was overall terrible. We had some of the best times we\\'ve had in the game driving that thing around. So dumb, hahaha\\n\\n-While driving around, I shot randomly at whatever the hell was around. I think I killed 2 deer, a boar, and shot a tree. Eventually we found a camp that belonged to the Mayflies, and we blew it up. Took 3-4 rocket hits. We cackled at our incredibly low-tier attack, and drove on. 5-10 minutes later, while riding around, I get banned. Permanently. Not a temp ban. Something I did triggered a PERMANENT BAN. 5-10 minutes later, the other guy who was riding around in the turrets got banned. No one else in the group got banned. It is unknown if this ban is due to us both being the gunners, but that\\'s really the only throughline between the two of us in this instance. We appealed the bans multiple times to no avail. All the bans say is \"Prohibited Behavior\" for both of us. For the record, we were not on open voice chat in game, and in general, neither of us are into harassing other players.\\n\\nNow look, I\\'m fine with this ban. Whatever. I spent a bunch of money on cosmetics, sure, but shit happens. At this point, I truly just want to know what the hell caused this ban. Its...insane that its THIS HARD to find out the exact cause. Why is this being obfuscated? What POSSIBLE reason is there to hide the exact cause of the ban? Wouldn\\'t you want people to know what they did so it doesn\\'t happen again? I want to reiterate that I am not a cheater. If I was, I\\'d have been doing much better at the game than I was, hahaha. The only other things running on my PC at the time was my VPN program (which was off) and Spotify. We weren\\'t doing anything troll-ish or obstructive. We were dinking around in a stupid car that the game lets you build, and blowing up the least valuable stuff in the game. I don\\'t even care about playing anymore. The mystery of this seemingly random ban is the only thing that keeps me caring about this now. WHAT DID WE DO?!?! I don\\'t get it, and I really want to, if only so none of you have to suffer this same stupid, confusing fate. This sucks, and my whole crew is just bummed out. I feel somewhat responsible, even though I have zero idea what I did to deserve this. Please, NetEase. All we\\'re asking for is some clarity here. \\n\\n###Discussion/Answer:\\nThink of it this way, getting banned just by raiding newb bases with a \"window wall truck\" is HILARIOUS as shit.\\n\\nPvP in this game is beyond a joke at this point. It\\'s not just trash - it\\'s actively dangerous to your account. People are getting slapped with random bans for absolutely nothing on PvP servers. So here\\'s the real deal: stick to PvE and keep your head down. \\n\\nThat\\'s what I do, and it\\'s the only way to stay sane. PvP is a toxic wasteland that\\'s not worth touching. Real talk, PvE is the only reason I even bothered with this game in the first place, and it\\'s sure as hell the only thing keeping me here now. If you value your account and your sanity, just pretend PvP doesn\\'t exist and enjoy the PvE content.\\n\\nAnd meanwhile, people on my server are openly abusing all kinds of bugs they can, talking openly about that on chat, posting videos of it even, harassing anyone who doesn\\'t agree with them, and not a single day of ban. Nice.\\n\\nProbably desynced and sped through the map triggering their anti cheat. They need to unban yall if this is true.\\n\\nesp as a destiny 2 head. you should know youll never find out why you were banned.   \\n\"read the ToS and figure it out yourself\" energy fr\\n\\nI would appeal, I have seen quite a few people on my server get unbanned after appealing whatever autoban they have.  Janky system that cannot even catch people intentionally manipulating the game but random stuff triggers it\\n\\nI don\\'t need to read this all.. cheaters wouldn\\'t put this much effort into a post.  \\n\\nFingers crossed you get through to a Dev and get your account back\\n\\nPvP servers have a bunch of cheaters and probably 10x as many people reporting each other over suspected cheating than there are actual cheaters. On top of this you have people banding together to use the reporting system maliciously by all reporting the same person that they don’t like and triggering an auto-ban or auto-mute.\\n\\nIt’s such a hostile environment and it’s indeed dangerous to your account to even be there.\\n\\nFor the most part the only “reward” from most of the PvP is the satisfaction of besting other players, wasting their time, and ruining their progress. I don’t experience satisfaction from that myself, which makes the PvP feel incredibly pointless.\\n\\nI am in a hive that has multiple territories cobbled together into a larger fortress and I’ve been involved in defending it on multiple occasions where even though we were successful at repelling the attackers: I was gaining absolutely nothing from it. I felt forced into participating in this useless activity simply for some enemy players’ amusement — trapped there standing around and shooting them until they get bored, give up, and leave us alone (which could be hours depending on how determined they are). Even when the battle was precipitated by securing a prism, it would often last long after the prism was secured because even though the enemy players knew that they lost, they were already there and set up for it so why not take the opportunity to play out their fantasy of causing other people grief simply for the fun of it. Five players each spending an hour and a half of their time for 10 points is just absurd.\\n\\nI went into Prismverse under the promise that the mechanics would be crafted in such a way to ensure balance and provide an appropriate distribution of rewards. Some mixture of promises and assumptions led me to believe that base engagements would only happen when securing a prism, you wouldn’t drop things when you die, and spawn/respawn would be more controlled so that PvP success wasn’t simply a matter of spawn camping and infinitely zerging from tents/bases placed 10m away. Instead, what we got was a lazy and senseless reward system slapped on top of wild no-rules open PvP. (Except for the secret hidden rules and malicious players that can lead to your account being permanently banned).\\n\\nI won’t be coming back to PvP. This crap simply does not happen on PvE servers. The only time somebody gets reported on PvE servers is when they go out of their way to make everybody else miserable by building/destroying maliciously in prime wars, abusing lag/glitches to launch vendor trucks, constantly trolling in chat, etc. The 99% vast majority of players on PvE servers just want to play the game and have fun; reporting each other isn’t even something you think about.\\n\\nQuick tutorial: how to get or not get banned in Once Human\\n\\nGet banned: go and do something, whatever, anything really. This thing you are doing starts causing some minor bugs and/or glitches. You laugh and say \"hahaha that\\'s so funny. let\\'s keep doing it hahahaha\". 5-10 minutes later you are permabanned.\\n\\nNot get banned: go and do something, whatever, anything really. This thing you are doing starts causing some minor bugs and/or glitches. FUUCKKIINNG PAAAANIIIIIIIIC!!! OMG IT\\'S A GLITCH IN MY ONCE HUMAN AAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHH!!!!! \\\\*Proceeds to quickly dismantle whatever structure or vehicle was glitching\\\\* \\\\*Proceeds to disband the team\\\\* \\\\*Everyone proceeds to get the hell away from where the glitch happened\\\\* \\\\*proceeds to either log out or go do some \"normal activities\" such as doing a silo for the 999th time, or gather some berries, maybe even cook a dish or two\\\\*. You made it! You are safe from ban!\\n\\nFun game, huh?\\n\\nI guarantee the \"appeals process\" is automatically set to deny everyone.  I appeal chat bans every time and get the same reply within SECONDS.  The reason you don\\'t get an explanation is because 90% of the game is auto-banning with A.I. and Netease doesn\\'t want to admit it.\\n\\nUnfairly get banned?  Tough.  Appeal the ban?  Auto-deny.  Top Warband in your server using Aimbot and other cheats?  \"Eh, we\\'ll get to it if we feel like it.\"\\n\\nYou didn\\'t get banned for the kill dozer. I don\\'t know what you got nabbed for, but bans don\\'t happen when you\\'re reported, or even when the report is reviewed. Bans happen in waves where they collect data that they believe identifies hackers or cheaters, and then bans them all at once.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nThe point is exactly to obfuscate what signal caused a particular person to get banned. If they tell hackers \"we banned you for this specific behavior\" hackers will build new tools that evade that signal, and make it harder to identify.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nI\\'m not saying you are a cheater or hacker, but netease is. This is exactly how they should treat someone they believe is trying to evade anticheat tooling.\\n\\nI go on for weeks yeeting annoying vendor trucks out of blackfell, haven\\'t had anything happen - and then this guy over here gets banned for shooting missles from a truck. A built in feature, I might add. Unlike what I do...\\n\\nThe asian/korean game dev logic will always make me laugh\\n\\nBy any chance, did your truck ever glitch and go into the sky? \\n\\nWe use battling guns on trucks, the recoil from the shots can cause the truck to do some wacky things. \\n\\nSomeone on Reddit recently was banned because they hit the skybox.\\n\\nBetween the massive lag, uneven sides and janky untested unbalanced weapon , im ready to quit this game.\\n\\nIt\\'s something you did the day before most likely. They don\\'t ban insta but rather hours and hours after the incident.\\n\\nI would file a chargeback claim with your credit/debit card provider (VISA/MasterCard), but let the support robots know this 2 weeks or so before filing with your company. [https://www.visa.co.uk/chargeback.html](https://www.visa.co.uk/chargeback.html)\\n\\nNo. And those bans regarding third-party software get responded to with “abnormal data on your account.” Our guys just got some nebulous “rule breaking.”\\n\\ni learned a long time ago that you never get answers from the devs of this game. “can you fix the lag devs?”\\nthen the update notes say “fixed rewards from rift anchor” like who tf cares about that, during prime war its still laggy af, even tho they apparentley addressed it. the game devs made a decent game, then their PR team decided to milk the hell out of it with skins and consmetics that cost absurdley amounts of money\\n\\nSomeone complained that some t more money, or is related to a dev or the PR team or something\\n\\nMaybe a streamer?\\n\\nI had considered picking this game back up after some early issues got me to put it down a month or two ago. Reading this and a couple other recent posts tipped my scale. Uninstalling as we speak. Thank you for saving me from the inevitable frustration. If you ever feel like playing Helldivers 2 or Trying out Starship Troopers. I\\'ll be you\\'re, riding around blowing stuff up, battle buddy any time. Cheers!\\n\\nCan’t wait to get off 004 and never pvp again. That server is full of people who spend the entire time mass reporting other players to try to get them banned or chat banned. They probably reported you for having fun and destroying their base.\\n3 days 9 hours till no more cum bucket boys!\\nI hope you somehow get your account back.\\n\\nDid you use reshade?\\n\\nDid you ask on the Discord?\\n\\nThe fact you said you spent money on cosmetics and are not upset about being banned is very very strange.....\\n\\nTimeline seems wonky, how’d yall have a truck and turrets in phase 1?\\n\\nThats true! And it wasn\\'t even as glorious as a base. It was a camp. What is that, 20 wood and 10 stone? Truly, we are the thing that needed to change in Once Human., hahaha\\n\\nThis is what I find more irritant about this game. There are so many random bans like OPs ban and then there are a horde of trolls in pvp servers constantly harassing people. \\n\\nIn my last pvp server there were some guys constantly spamming bad words in chat. I reported them every single time and there was always a message in my inbox \"the player has been punished\" just to see the same guy talking sh** a couple hours later (probably just a couple hours ban).\\n\\nThen, before the season was over, I found out that a guild leader that was enemy from those guys got a very hard chat ban, not sure how many weeks. I used to play 6-8 hours daily on the game and I never saw that guy talking and he was a nice guy to everyone, they just probably spammed reports on him and got banned. \\n\\nThis game is a joke and they only care about selling $300 skins. I\\'m just staking starchrom now, not playing anymore\\n\\nYou speak the true-true. I have very little hope of ever hearing exactly why, but this mystery is so wild to me. I genuinely just cant understand where we crossed the line.\\n\\nThat really would be awesome, but I\\'m not gonna hold my breath. This is mostly just an awareness post. We\\'ve been trying to get any kind of answer since it happened, so at this point, I\\'m happy just giving a PSA, however vague and unhelpful the end result is, hahaha\\n\\nThe biggest problem with OH pvp is that it seems to be set up to only retain the worst kinds of players...between the unpunished rampant cheating and botched implementation of the easily abusable reporting system, the roughly 80-85% of people who play survival-like games for the challenge and good fights such a thing usually entails end up leaving, because they aren\\'t getting what they came for. That, unfortunately, leaves just the cheaters, exploiters, and griefers. \\n\\nAs far as the PvE side, you\\'re right on multiple counts..it\\'s usually much more chill, with people content to just play the game..with the odd exception of some dork malding about the blackfell trucks on this sub at least once a week. Hell, even the pvp events on PvE servers are more chill. Depending on where you are in the scenario, odds of anyone even showing up to compete for sproutlets is pretty low..and even when they do, odds are, they\\'re usually pretty chill with just taking turns with the jellyfish hat\\n\\n+Report the bug:)\\n\\nLmao this literally happened to me last night\\n\\nI was running a silo with a friend and went down. Crawled around for a few seconds and... got back up and healed over time to full???\\n\\nIt wasn\\'t my teammate. I basically panicked and said WELP I\\'m supposed to be dead, just let me stand here and die...\\n\\nTurns out it was my drone that rezzed and healed me.\\n\\nFunny right? Except that THIS is the attitude that the devs have fostered - where you\\'re terrified of a purposeful, intended, in game mechanic because you think you will get banned for it.\\n\\nGreat job Starry. Great job NetEase.\\n\\nOkay, that\\'s a perfectly acceptable reason to obfuscate, I agree. But surely there has to be a middle area between the vaguest possible terms and telling me the full details of exactly how I was breaking the rules. \"Prohibited Behavior\" is essentially useless information. Its so little detail that it just lets the mind run wild with what could have possibly happened. I agree with your overall stance, though. Its an understandable, if not insanely frustrating and potentially damaging process. These two bans have now removed 6-8 players who were all paying customers (we all bought cosmetics, you gotta support the stuff that does good while being \"free\") who, to the best of all their knowledge, were following all the rules.\\n\\nThis is incorrect. Bans also happen when the automated systems detect anything they deem as suspicious behavior. In the past passengers have gotten banned instantly when vehicles glitched on collision with the environment and got launched into the sky box. And the reason that they won\\'t tell you why you were banned isn\\'t some anti hackware strategy it\\'s because the bans and appeals are automated. It would take an actual human being to answer questions like that and that is just not something this game does. Customer support is basically non-existent.\\n\\nthats true bans arent instant like OP thinks. It musta been for something else entirely\\n\\nThere certainly WAS some glitching, but mostly it was people floating in mid-air who, on their screens, were still inside the truck. That was really giving us some solid laughs, ngl\\n\\nI did. The game had potential, but between what you stated, shit like OP went through, and NetEase\\'s greed and complete disregard for customer service, I just can\\'t get behind it anymore. I\\'m done. It was cool while it lasted.\\n\\nThen do it?\\n\\nThere\\'s an ingame ticket system for those who get banned.  \\nYou can appeal, but only a standard reply will come.  \\nNo questions are being answered.  \\nBans are random. Usually an automatic result from chat reporting. \\n\\nLack of a customer support. Everything on discord is bot/AI.\\n\\nI have moved on from this game.\\n\\nWe did, several times.  \\nI personally have 4 in game tickets shrugged off with canned responses. An unanswered email and an unanswered discord chat with their \"Live Customer Service\"\\n\\nI now have a ticket open with Steam that is sitting with their Tier 3 Account Services team.\\n\\nEdited in the \"3\"\\n\\nThis happened 4 days ago, on 10/9/24. I don\\'t think anywhere in this post mentions a phase.\\n\\nIt was phase 3 of prismverse.\\n\\nNGL, the slow-moving truck with cannons rocking up to someone\\'s base for a raid kinda reminds me of the \"boats\" my mates and I used to build in Ark to hit coastal bases back when pvp there was still decent. Nothing special, and by all metrics, an unholy abomination aesthetically.. but it got the job done\\n\\nYou receive an automated reply asking for your in-game name and user ID to complete the bug report. 5-10 minutes later you are permabanned. Enjoy :)\\n\\nYeah man it\\'s a really shitty stonewall to hit if you\\'re looking to appeal, I agree. If you spent a lot of money, you could try issuing a charge back from your cc company - it\\'s likely that you won\\'t get the money back, but someone will probably have to be more clear about what terms of service you violated.\\n\\n\\nI mean, you probably won\\'t be allowed to play the game again after that but if the lack of closure is bothering you that much, it\\'s an option\\n\\nOh, interesting. So likely someone COULD tell me the cause of the ban, but such a person just...doesn\\'t exist. Hahhaha, that\\'s amazing\\n\\nMy guess would be that something about the turrets being on the truck and moving around while firing registered in a wonky way on the server logs where it made it appear as if you were teleporting or teleporting the turrets around. My wife was watching me drive around my gun truck and the turrets were warping all over the place.\\n\\nyeah, first season i played PVE and it was really fun, this game scratch so many of my itch. Base building, boss fight, \"mmo\" like aspect and nice visuals. I might just stick to PVE only if they have great content in the future, might skip a season for it.\\n\\nI did too\\n\\nIts really sad. This game was really hooking us, but this is essentially irresponsible on the developers part. Sad state of modern gaming, I guess.\\n\\nThat sucks. Is it a device wide ban or can you make a new account?\\n\\nYou didn’t, I just read it as you hadn’t been able to play for a week or so. My L.\\n\\nThis is all a bummer, but the way the game is going I don’t see it lasting much longer unfortunately. The divide between PvP and PvE servers has already split the player base. \\n\\nNow things like this happening to the PvE players that are trying PvP for the first time is turning everyone else that might have even thought of trying it away.\\n\\nFair enough. I don\\'t really mind the CC charges. I\\'m not, like, actively hostile to Once Human or its devs and community managers. They can keep the money, whatever. I think I just needed to be clear with my side of this story. I saw a few folks on my friends other posts about this incident talk about how they weren\\'t the people it happened to, and thus were giving an incomplete story. This is the story from a first hand account. An unknown thing happened, I got banned, and I really just want to make sure it doesn\\'t happen to anyone else if its avoidable. Not a fun thing to go through. Nice to get some other perspectives, though. Genuinely didn\\'t consider the actual hackers gleaning info from their ban data.\\n\\nThat\\'s our best guess too. Ah well, it is what it is.\\n\\nThey banned our characters, so we COULD make new characters and start again, but each of us had several hundred hours in these characters. I had 220, and Doc had over 400. Lots of stuff we had acquired over that time is just dust in the wind. Makes it very hard to want to try to build it back up again when we now know that it can all be gone in an instant for little to no reason.\\n\\nI feel the same way, amigo. This game really had some solid promise. Me and my crew are HUGE survival game fiends, so an MMO survival game with really awesome creature designs that has blueprints to earn over time was, like, RIGHT up our alley. Now its all gone to shit because of god knows what reason. Its honestly like you said, its just a bummer.\\n\\n>Netcode is so shitty that players and objects lag uncontrollably \\n\\n**PLAYER MUST BE CHEATING BETTER BAN THEM**\\n\\nClown shit\\n\\nIf it\\'s character ban, doesn\\'t that mean you don\\'t lose the stuff you bought with real money, considering that is account wide?\\n\\nTo be fair, the game is on a wipe every season cycle anyway, but it does suck to lose all your blueprints.\\n\\nYeah, the game is amazing when all the bullshit is put aside and im huffing straight copium that theyll be able to resolve most problems soon.\\n\\nYeah, I know. We were on our third season, so I\\'m cool with losing all that stuff. But I had a near-perfect Bingo sniper that I brough with me when I hopped to a new season.

The entire gaming community has become insufferable. I would hate being a dev in todays era. It’s not even out yet and people are unhappy and complaining about it already good god\\n\\nI would rather it be small with more active players so the game doesn\\'t feel like a total waste land without players.\\n\\nThe map doesn\\'t need to be big.\\n\\nlooks fine to me\\n\\nIn terms of size, it actually seems about the same effectively as the original.\\n\\nAhh time to find a suitable oil rig and nice lake to set up camp on once again the excitement!\\n\\nThe reason it looks \"smaller,\" is because it\\'s more horizontal, rather than vertical. If you compare the actual area (math term), I imagine it\\'s right around the same amount of space.\\n\\nI still don\\'t know why they couldn\\'t just expand the map into this area instead of making its own server I want to go back and forth\\n\\nIt\\'s smaller but more dense with content, for example current map blackheart has 1 poi... while Way of Winter is loaded with POIs.\\n\\nWe\\'ll see in the release, if it really is small as we think it is.\\n\\nI hope one day there’ll be a scenario using the full map, that would be cool\\n\\nDo we know if it\\'s a new zone attached to the existing map or a wholey new world that doesn\\'t overlap at all?\\n\\nIs there going to be perma servers or do I still have no real reason to play\\n\\nQuestion, in my Server we are phase 3, do we need to wait for phase end or ?\\n\\nThat map does look tiny as hell\\n\\nIs it on top of the current map?\\n\\nIf it\\'s more dense with content and things to do it will be fine. There is a lot of useless space in the first map, just long stretches of nothing.\\n\\nThats 30% smaller then I expected. But curent map is too large. Most of Chulk Peak is useless.\\n\\nDoes it not include the snow covered mountain peaks?\\n\\nid rather a small map full of content than a large map that feels barren and empty\\n\\nSo what’s the south west beyond chalk peak going to be? Next scenario?\\n\\nwhen is this being released\\n\\nLooks disappointing. The amount of wait I was expecting much more tbh.\\n\\nSo wait.. it’s not even an extension? Theyre taking out the entire rest of the map? Tf?\\n\\nOh man..ima be stuck doing nothing after two weeks. 😅\\n\\nAfter getting handed the same content/map that all the betas ran, are you shocked at the lackluster content being handed out now?\\n\\nI have been let down since day 1 launch.\\n\\nAwww fuck\\n\\nThat in addition to the current map.  They\\'re adding on to it.\\n\\nYeah black heart kinda sucks\\n\\nit looks huge actually\\n\\nhope we will get some nice highways to expore it on wheels!\\n\\nThat looks a bit misleading, because it\\'s not the entire \"snow\" area that is open.\\n\\nI was in the pool!\\n\\nI can agree with you  but sadly there is justification for fans reactions.\\n\\nMost games release in beta states that require another 6 months to a year of fixes to make the game actually playable.\\nThis naturally results in a bitter customer base.\\n\\nThe fix is quite simple. \\n\\nJust stop being bad at telling your Investors they can wait till the game is done. Every game pushed out too early is because of earnings calls and quarterly reports. Bad decision making from the financial side of the business that controls the rest of the business no matter how often their demands result in losses.\\n\\nShip complete games and fans enjoy it.\\n\\n\"Late is temporary, suck is forever.\" -Gaben\\n\\nHelldivers could have e used another 6 months in the oven. Once Human probably could have used another year.\\n\\nDevs fall into this moronic idea that you have to constantly update graphics to newest technology which often sacrifices content and playability. \\n\\nYet time and again players have proven they will play a well made game that looks like Roblox more consistently than a buggy mess that looks like God Of War.\\n\\nDevs have lost touch.\\n\\nTotally agree with you here. I don’t know if it’s humans in general, but I can definitely confirm that gamers as a group are some of the most miserable people on earth.\\n\\nI take angry playerbase over dead playerbase. On the latter example, i would be out of a job. Million of people worked on industry with less then stellar reputation, they sleep just fine with money on their bank account.\\n\\nFound the Ubisoft employee\\n\\nGame literally about looting and survive in post apocalypses, so less players looks kinda logical and besides nobody will interfere with quests and strongholds=)\\n\\nLooks like north of the map and we’ll probably just  be limited by “DONT GO FURTHER” and “STAHP PLEASE”. Then murdered by Mitsuko.\\n\\nNo\\n\\nMost of Blackwell (NE portion) is empty too.\\n\\nChalk Peak at least as pollution in some of the empty spaces. No oil in NE Blackwell, as far a I can tell.\\n\\n10/17\\n\\nI mean honestly, even as someone who really enjoys this game, that seems to be the theme.\\nI enjoy the first two weeks, the third week is when I hit cap and activities slow, and by week 4 I\\'m pretty much done with the season.\\n\\ni don\\'t believe you can access the old map in the new scenario.  there are 5 towns showing in this new map,   and there should be at least two new silos\\n\\nif they reduce the amount of \"clutter\" on the road that you can crash into and improve handling of the car, driving always seems clunky\\n\\nIt looks like a lot of mountain area. Depends how much is explorable.\\n\\nOnce Human definitely needed more time in the oven and devs actually planned on letting it cook longer, however they needed to put something out to generate revenue for them to continue development on it. I had been following development on the game for about a year prior to its release and all estimates put the window at being around Q1 or Q2 2025 - I was genuinely shocked when they launched it early. Even with all of that happening, the game is incredibly solid outside of server performance, offers plenty of content and performs relatively well outside of the server itself. I never expected Once Human to take off as hard as it did and they’re suffering from the same type of success as Helldivers 2. \\n\\nThe difference between Helldivers 2 and Once Human right now for me is that the dev team for Helldivers 2 essentially told their players to fuck off and did the polar opposite of what the playerbase was begging for. Time will only tell if Once Human does the same or if they take feedback and go in the direction their players are asking for.\\n\\nFound the 🤡\\n\\nNo I would rather interact and play with others than play solo. Game isn\\'t fun at all alone.\\n\\nHow long will it last tho?\\n\\nI totally agree. There\\'s still stuff to do but you gotta replay content or farm energy link. And even then you\\'re out of controllers at one point.\\n\\nYeah, they said Way of Winter was specifically “all new portions of the map” and we have no access to old zones. Idk where people heard it’s both.\\n\\nThe car’s handling definitely is odd in the sense that it feels like they attempted to implement some actual driving sim physics to it. Once you learn to let off of the throttle for turning and brake a bit before starting your handbrake slides, the car becomes infinitely more controllable.\\n\\nMaybe, i\\'m just playing solo and for me it\\'s good, cause i playing how i want and with pace which i want.\\n\\nSpeak for yourself I have a blast playing solo. Still the map being a bit smaller doesn’t mean you’re only able to play it solo like what 😂\\n\\nI understand you. Went from our novice pve sever, which has only ever had about 20 active voices, to a new hard pve server and I couldn\\'t get over my shock that there\\'s other players in blackfell constantly. There\\'s a multitude of people showing up for public World events. There\\'s pw being run constantly, different voices in the chat. It\\'s great tbh :)\\n\\n[video](https://www.youtube.com/live/VjyKeSRUIzg?si=aFg4vhY2EHE1gV_j)\\n\\nHehe.  Believe it or not, going into the North season, I\\'ll have over 450 controllers.  I\\'ve never seen the need to grind silos or dungeons for random-stat deviates, and I\\'ve got tons of legendary mods just doing the normal routine.\\n\\nI\\'m super casual in games like this...which is probably why I run out of things to do by chapter 4.  I DO do all the PW, and I solo every dungeon and silo on hard, I just don\\'t touch pro or LEA any more than I have to.\\n\\nNot even sure where I saw that.  Probably from a random youtuber.  I was wrong though.\\n\\nThe motorcycle has the worst handling I\\'ve ever experienced in a game. It has the turn radius of a semi, even at low speeds. It\\'s crazy that you can full steer one way and take an eternity to change lanes when at full speed.\\n\\nNo, they mean how populated the world feels. It can feel like you\\'re entirely alone and you never ever bump in to another player on some servers. On others, there\\'s people running around the everywhere, it\\'s dope.\\n\\nI’ve watched a few videos on YouTube where it was mentioned as a possibility but I think once the 1.3 dev stream came around, these folks should have maybe updated or removed their less informed content. Just hope no one is real disappointed when they realize that’s all.\\xa0\\n\\nHave you tried slowing down or using power slide maneuver...\\n\\nAnd again, just because the map is smaller doesn’t mean you’re going to be the only person playing on it and not seeing anybody else. Idk what I said that confused you but that’s about as simple as I can make it\\n\\nwhen in a car i often switch seat to turn faster since it seems to drastically reduce speed'),\n",

I hope its better for you than me in this game currently. You may have seen a few posts from folks on NA P\\\\_Clash-X0004 who\\'s friends got permabanned for unknown reasons while driving around. Welp, I\\'m one of those friends. My in-game name was Huenheim, and my ID is 150278471. \\n\\nI\\'m mostly making this post so its clear and from one of the people it directly happened to. I want to assure you that I am NOT a cheater. I get that every cheater says that, and I have zero ways to \"prove it\", but its 100% the truth. I\\'m an old Destiny 2 head, and trust me when I say you build up a pretty healthy intolerance for cheating after going through the hell of cheaters in PVP in that game. Honestly, I\\'m not sure me or any my crew will ever return to this game, which is a real shame because we really were loving it, but this Sword of Damocles that\\'s hanging over all our heads about these bans is really putting all of us off.\\n\\nHere is the sequence of events from my perspective:\\n\\n-I have been in the process of moving to a new house recently, and thus was unable to play with any real regularity for the week preceding the day I got banned. I played a small amount later in the evenings on a day or two (mostly to make the kind of drone I spec\\'d into for some Hive-mates and tend my farm), but otherwise, I think I maybe went exploring once.\\n\\n-The day we got banned, one of my Hive-mates made a wild truck we all called \"The Killdozer\". It was basically a giant rectangle made out of window walls that we could shoot missile launches out from. It was janky, moved slow as hell, and was overall terrible. We had some of the best times we\\'ve had in the game driving that thing around. So dumb, hahaha'),\n",

I think I killed 2 deer, a boar, and shot a tree. Eventually we found a camp that belonged to the Mayflies, and we blew it up. Took 3-4 rocket hits. We cackled at our incredibly low-tier attack, and drove on. 5-10 minutes later, while riding around, I get banned. Permanently. Not a temp ban. Something I did triggered a PERMANENT BAN. 5-10 minutes later, the other guy who was riding around in the turrets got banned. No one else in the group got banned. It is unknown if this ban is due to us both being the gunners, but that\\'s really the only throughline between the two of us in this instance. We appealed the bans multiple times to no avail. All the bans say is \"Prohibited Behavior\" for both of us. For the record, we were not on open voice chat in game, and in general, neither of us are into harassing other players.'),\n",

I spent a bunch of money on cosmetics, sure, but shit happens. At this point, I truly just want to know what the hell caused this ban. Its...insane that its THIS HARD to find out the exact cause.

I want to reiterate that I am not a cheater. If I was, I\\'d have been doing much better at the game than I was, hahaha. The only other things running on my PC at the time was my VPN program (which was off) and Spotify. We weren\\'t doing anything troll-ish or obstructive. We were dinking around in a stupid car that the game lets you build, and blowing up the least valuable stuff in the game. I don\\'t even care about playing anymore.

It\\'s not just trash - it\\'s actively dangerous to your account. People are getting slapped with random bans for absolutely nothing on PvP servers.

Even when the battle was precipitated by securing a prism, it would often last long after the prism was secured because even though the enemy players knew that they lost, they were already there and set up for it so why not take the opportunity to play out their fantasy of causing other people grief simply for the fun of it.
